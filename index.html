            Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like
            IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

            First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless
            edit-build-debug
            cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.

            Available for macOS, Linux, and Windows - Ain't that amazing!

            How to Set Up Visual Studio Code:
            1. Download and install VS Code.
            2. Create a new file.
            3. See an overview of the user interface.
            4. Install support for your favorite programming language.
            5. Change your keyboard shortcuts and easily migrate from other editors using keymap extensions.
            6. Customize your editor with themes.

            The Console can be used to log information as part of the JavaScript development process, as well as allow
            you to interact with a web page by carrying out JavaScript expressions within the page's context.
            Essentially, the Console provides you with the ability to write, manage, and monitor JavaScript on demand.

            To open the Debug Console, use the Debug Console action at the top of the Debug pane or use the View: Debug
            Console command (Ctrl+Shift+Y).

            If you want to print something on Console, use the log() Method. The console.log() is a function in JavaScript that
            is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be
            displayed to the user.
